Linked List
1.A linked list is a linear data structure that includes a series of connected nodes
2.Each node consists of a data value and a pointer that points to the next node
3.The list elements can be easily inserted or removed without reallocation or
reorganization of the entire structure
4.Random access of elements is not feasible and accessing an element has linear time
complexity
5.The linked list data structure supports three main operations
    Insertion - to add an element at the beginning, end or at a given index in the list
    Deletion - to remove an item given its index or value
    Search to find an element given its value

Usages - 
1.All app's of both stack and queues are applications of linked lists.
2.Image viewer (move front and back images.)



steps to create LL:
1.create new node to add to list. node contains data and pointer to another node



  print() {
    if (this.isEmpty()) {
      return "Empty";
    }
    let current = this.head;
    let listValues = "";
    while (current) {
      listValues += `${current.value} `;
      current = current.next;
    }
    console.log(listValues);
  }
