ALGO - 
    it is a set of well defined instr to perform a operation/to solve a problem.

   char of algo - 
        1.well defined ip and op 
        2.steps should be clear
        3.it should be language independent

one problem can se solved in many ways.

---

Time to run algo depends on
1.prog language
2.computer that runs the prog
3.other prog running at same Time
4.quality of program
5.no of ip's


We evaluate the performance of an algo in terms of inp size.
1.TC  -  amount of time taken by an algo to run, as a fn of inp size.
2.SC  -  amount of memory taken by an algo to run, as a fn of inp size.


Notations for complexity - 
we use ASYMPTOTIC Notations

1. big O - worst case complexity (it describes the complexity of an algo using algebric terms.)
2. omega - best case complexity
3. theta - average case complexity


SC - constant, linear ,log

------------------

Obj, Array - BIG-Obj

OBJ - 
1.collection of key value pairs. 
2.insert/remove/access - TC = constant.
3.search - TC = linear
4.obj.keys - TC = linear
5.obj.values - TC = linear
6.obj.entries - TC = linear

Array - 
1.ordered collection of values
2.insert/remove at end - TC = constant.
3.insert/remove at beginning - TC = linear. (if we remove ele at beginning then the index for all remainig elemnets should be updated.)
4.access - constant
5.search - linear
6.push/pop - constant
7.shift/unshift/concat/slice/splice - linear
8.foreach/map/filter/reduce - linear
